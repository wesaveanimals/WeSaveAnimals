        <div id="rescuedetail"><div id="rescueinfo">In a perfect world, every home would have a rescue dog. In most cases, a shelter dog winds up rescuing the person who saved him. Dog adoption is one of the best ways to clear the shelters and enrich your life with a furry new friend.

            Rescue dogs are hidden treasures waiting to shine. Not only will a rescue pup help break the cycle of pet overpopulation, but he gets the opportunity to have a long, happy life with you.
            Though many shelter dogs have had a rough start in life, they are lost souls looking for second chances. The benefits of saving a dog are endless. Older rescue dogs are past the puppy training and nipping years. On the flip side, puppies in shelters haven’t had a chance to show the world what they can do.
            
            To celebrate the human-animal bond, we’ve gathered up 50 of our favorite rescue dog quotes. If you’ve adopted a dog or know someone who has, these quotes will touch your heartstrings. Share them with family and friends, and feel free to use them in your social media posts.</div></div>

            <div id="medicaldetail"><div id="medicalinfo">For pet owners, veterinarians, and farmers and ranchers, medicines are essential for ensuring animal welfare, preventing diseases from passing between animals and humans, and protecting our food supply.
                Vaccines are one of the top tools for keeping animals healthy. Inoculating animals with vaccines protects them from needing later treatment, which reduces animal suffering and losses. These medicines are a safe, proven way to protect animals from diseases like rabies, parvovirus, and E. coli. In turn, this helps protect public health – fewer sick animals and disease outbreaks means a reduced chance of transmitting illnesses from animals to people.
                Pharmaceuticals help animals live longer, higher-quality lives by addressing infections, diabetes, obesity, pain, cancer and age-related diseases. Just as humans rely on doctors to diagnose ailments and prescribe treatments, animals need veterinarians to manage many types of pharmaceutical treatments.

                    Wildlife rehabilitation organizations are also increasingly recognized for their potential to contribute to disease surveillance, including diseases of importance to domestic animal and human healt as well as emerging threats Until recently, platforms for sharing information among organizations have been lacking, resulting in missed opportunities to detect unusual events when sick animals are brought to multiple, uncoordinated centres across a region.
                    In addition, efforts to use rehabilitation data to contribute to disease surveillance have previously focused on verified diagnostic data rather than clinical pre-diagnostic data, limiting the information's use to contribute to early detection. When linked through a formal network, these organizations have the potential to assimilate and share large amounts of clinical data in near real-time, collectively representing a highly valuable and under-used resource that can be used to complement existing 
                    surveillance efforts for early and enhanced detection.In this study, we aimed to develop and pilot an online surveillance system that integrates pre-diagnostic clinical health data entered in near real-time by a network of wildlife rehabilitation organizations to facilitate early and enhanced detection of wildlife morbidity and mortality events
